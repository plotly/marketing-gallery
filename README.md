Public repository of apps from the marketing gallery 

# About
This monorepo contains publicly available code of apps from the Dash marketing gallery. Each folder in the monorepo contains one app, along with instructions for running it locally. 

This repo is automatically updated EXCLUSIVELY by a private repo containing all apps in the marketing gallery to keep them current with the apps deployed in the gallery. This monorepo should ONLY be updated using that pipeline, not directly.
